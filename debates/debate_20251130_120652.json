Let's begin with the opening statements.\n\n**Progressive Activist, please share your position.**\n\n**Progressive Activist:** \nI believe that AI regulation is essential to ensure that technological advancements benefit everyone and do not exacerbate existing social inequalities. We need rules that protect privacy, prevent bias, and ensure AI is used ethically and transparently. Without oversight, AI could lead to job displacement and discrimination. \n\n**Libertarian Individualist, your turn.**\n\n**Libertarian Individualist:** \nI argue that heavy-handed AI regulation stifles innovation and limits individual freedom. The market should drive AI development, allowing for innovation without unnecessary governmental interference. People and businesses should have the liberty to explore AI frontiers with minimal restrictions, without fear of bureaucracy.\n\nThank you both for your positions. Now, let's deepen the discussion in Phase 2: Clarification & Engagement. \n\nWe will begin by asking participants to explain or summarize each other's views. \n\n**Progressive Activist, can you summarize the Libertarian Individualist's main points?** \n\n[Current Phase: Clarification & Engagement, Next Speaker: Progressive Activist]",
